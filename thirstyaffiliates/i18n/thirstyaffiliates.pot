"                               <p>It lets you hide long, and often confusing looking, affiliate link URLs behind another URL called a redirect. When your visitors click on that new URL they are automatically redirected to your affiliate link.</p>\n"
"                               <p>This is helpful for five reasons:</p>\n"
"                               <ol><li>AESTHETICS: Affiliate links are often long and ugly as mentioned and this can look off putting to visitors. ThirstyAffiliates redirects make them shorter and more attractive to click on like \"http://example.com/recommends/some-product-name\"</li>\n"
"                               <li>PROTECTION: It hides the affiliate code, so malicious software (malware) cannot sniff out the affiliate code for common affiliate programs and replace it with their own code instead. In this way, it protects your commissions.</li>\n"
"                               <li>CONVENIENCE: If the affiliate program ever changes the link code you’ll only have ONE place to change it on your blog, rather than going through all your content and changing every instance of the link.</li>\n"
"                               <li>CATEGORIZATION: You categorize your affiliate links into logical groups which can make managing them much simpler.</li>\n"
"                               <li>STATISTICS: Finally, because your visitors are travelling via a ThirstyAffiliates redirect, the plugin can provide you with statistics on what is being clicked.</li></ol>\n"
"                               <p>You can now create an “Affiliate Link” in this new section in your dashboard. This view shows you all the affiliate links you are managing with ThirstyAffiliates.</p>"
